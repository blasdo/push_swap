# Libft Version 3.0 Overview

Libft undergoes a "major" update in each "common core" rank, with version milestones as follows:
- Version 1.0 (commit aaa787031297aed42a92bf6a407c4ffb92ae8495)
- Version 2.0 (commit f61cf6b21b0c7d8aaba51f404d6ecd98f1e080e6)
- Version 3.0 (currently in development)

The release schedule aligns with the submission of the last project of this rank.

In version 3.0, the primary enhancement is comprehensive documentation tailored to streamline usage in the last two "common core" ranks in C. New functions specific to this rank have also been incorporated.

Each version has a branch; the current version (in development) is in "main".
